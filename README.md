# Birthday Card Animation

## Summary
A fun and interactive animated birthday card built with HTML and CSS. Features a colorful cake, flickering candles, a car moving along the cake, and confetti, with the text "Happy Birthday" appearing letter by letter.

## Purpose
The project demonstrates creative use of CSS animations, transitions, and keyframes to produce a visually appealing interactive greeting. It serves as both a learning project and a template for web-based interactive content.

## Demo

## Tools / Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the card
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **GitHub**: Version control and hosting

## How It Works
- The cake, candles, and car are styled entirely with CSS.  
- Animations use **CSS keyframes** for moving elements, flickering lights, and confetti motion.  
- The "Happy Birthday" text appears letter by letter using a **typing animation** with a blinking cursor effect.  
- Confetti and banknotes float in the background using repeated animations for a celebratory effect.  

## Potential Applications
- UI/UX design elements for festive web pages  
- Interactive greeting cards on websites  
- Educational projects demonstrating CSS animations  
- Web development practice for creative, responsive, and animated content
