# Birthday Card Animation

## Summary
A fun and interactive animated birthday card built with HTML and CSS. Features a colorful cake, flickering candles, a car moving along the cake, and confetti, with the text "Happy Birthday" appearing letter by letter.

## Purpose
The project demonstrates creative use of CSS animations, transitions, and keyframes to produce a visually appealing interactive greeting. It serves as both a learning project and a template for web-based interactive content.

## Tools / Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the card
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **GitHub**: Version control and hosting

## How It Works
- The cake, candles, and car are styled entirely with CSS.  
- Animations use **CSS keyframes** for moving elements, flickering lights, and confetti motion.  
- The "Happy Birthday" text appears letter by letter using a **typing animation** with a blinking cursor effect.  
- Confetti and banknotes float in the background using repeated animations for a celebratory effect.  

## Potential Applications
- UI/UX design elements for festive web pages  
- Interactive greeting cards on websites  
- Educational projects demonstrating CSS animations  
- Web development practice for creative, responsive, and animated content

# âœ¨ Potion Project â€“ Animated Heart Bottle

A visually charming CSS animation of a magical potion bottle with floating hearts.  
This project combines creative web design, CSS animations, and smooth motion effects to bring a whimsical, modern aesthetic to the web.

## âœ¨ Summary

The **Potion Project** is a front-end visual experiment that animates a glass potion bottle filled with glowing liquid and floating hearts. Each heart rises and bursts in sync, while a special heart travels through the cork before fading away gracefully.  
The project showcases the creative possibilities of **pure HTML and CSS animations**.

---

## âœ¨ Purpose

This project was designed to:
- Explore creative **CSS keyframe animations** and **pseudo-element shapes**.
- Demonstrate how to simulate natural motion and transparency using only front-end technologies.
- Provide a reusable decorative animation f

## âœ¨ Tools & Technologies

- **HTML5** â€” structure and layout of the scene  
- **CSS3** â€” all animations, gradients, and shapes  
- **Flexbox** â€” layout alignment  
- **Keyframes** â€” smooth heart and liquid motion  
- **Box shadows & gradients** â€” light, depth, and liquid effects  

---

## âœ¨ Potential Applications

This animation can be used for:
- **UI Design** â€“ loading screens, transitions, or decorative effects.  
- **Websites** â€“ fantasy themes, landing pages, or portfolio animations.  
- **Web Development Demos** â€“ examples of advanced CSS animations and shapes.  
- **Learning Projects** â€“ understanding transformations, pseudo-elements, and timing functions.  

---

## âœ¨ How It Works

1. The **bottle** and **liquid** are built using CSS shapes and gradients.  
2. **Hearts** are formed from a rotated diamond with two circular pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`).  
3. Each heart uses a different **animation delay** and **trajectory** to create a natural, randomized floating effect.  
4. A **special heart** rises through the cork, shrinks, fades, and bursts.  
5. Everything runs automatically â€” no JavaScript required.
